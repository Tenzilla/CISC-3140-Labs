# CISC-3140-Labs

# This is a repository for the submission of my CISC 3140 lab assignments!

Lab 1: The first awk program file extracts the total amount of the stats for each cars and orders them in descending order. The second program file top3.awk chooses the top 3 total scorers from groups of the car models and displays them.
By setting the Makefile target and commands to execute each of the .awk program files, using the command "make" or "make lab1" allows it to run the command of the .awk files and obtain the latest version. A potential dependency required for the script to function is the .txt file in which the output will be displayed onto.
