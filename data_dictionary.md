## Database Schema 

This is how to create relational tables in SQLite3. 

Based from the past lab, the submodule data_lab1 is now updated after the changed are 'git pulled'. 

Afterwards, a database is created using SQLite3 and within it, the three tables named: Cars, Judges, and Car_Score. These all contain sorted data from the data.csv submodule. Using the tables created, two SQLite3 queries are created to show specific sorted data. Each sorted data (the output) is then put into separate .csv files named extract1.csv and extract2.csv. Lastly the Judges table is updated by creating new fields to show timestamps, the number of cars judged, and the average speed a score is calculated.
