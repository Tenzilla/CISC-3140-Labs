Hi, my name is Tenzin Shedup. I'm a senior Computer Science major at Brooklyn College. My career interests are broad, from getting a developer position to starting a software company. But to choose a few that I can achieve earlier, I am aiming to dive into Full-Stack Development/Lead Developer/Software Engineer positions! I try to grow my hobbies and switch a lot but my main hobbies are swimming, snowboarding, billiards, and gaming.
